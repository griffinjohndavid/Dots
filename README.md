# [Dots](https://github.com/jgriffin3/Dots)
Dots is a simple Android game in which users select two or more dots of the same color. You can select dots that are adjacent to each other but not diagonally. If you created a complete box, all the dots of that color will be removed.

#### Requirements
The only requirement for *Dots* is an Android device running Android 4.2 Jelly Bean (SDK 17) and sufficient memory on the device to install.

#### Features
* Two great Game Modes:
	* Timed: a race against the clock. Make as many connections as you can in 30s.
	* Moves: a challenge of the mind. You have 15 moves to score the most points as possible. Make your connections wisely.
* Color Blind Modes
	* Have trouble distinguishing the dots? Turn on Color Blind Mode in settings to display characters on each dot.
* Shake for a New game
	* Don't feel like slowing down to press a button to start a new game? We don't blame you! Now all you have to do is shake your device to start a new game.

#### Known Issues
There are currently no issues known. If you discover an issue, please submit it via the [Issues](https://github.com/jgriffin3/Dots/issues) tab on GitHub.

#### Extra Credit Completed
As extra credit, we implemented a way to shake the device and start a new game.
